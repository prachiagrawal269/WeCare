        WeCare is a digital platform that helps NGOs to get onboard with technology to promote their campaigns. It also helps people in discoverability of various campaigns as well as provide detailed information about them. 
        
        Volunteers can also contribute towards ongoing campaigns, run by different NGOs, via this platform. The best part about the platform is the ease of use and its effectiveness so that anyone can easily promote and market their campaigns to increase their visibility.
